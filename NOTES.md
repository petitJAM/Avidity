# Platform Notes

## Windows

```
ANDROID_HOME = C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
```

Android SDK tools are located at:
```
~/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/tools/
```

But, there's now an `$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/` directory that contains the `emulator.exe` file that we want for running 
commands.

## Linux
